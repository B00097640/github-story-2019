## Chapter 02

### Validation
Annabelle really started to lose her character and started to show signs 
to others that she was desperate for validation. 
People could sense this and would give her minus rating that would 
ruin her overall rating. A few days later Annabelle received a phone call
from her old friend Stacy who use to bully her. 
The reason Stacy had called her was that Annabelle’s was 4.2 
and had a high-class validation. Stacy called her because she was an 
old friend and wanted her to become her best woman. 

Stacy had a 5.1 rating and the people that would be at the wedding 
would be a minimum of a 4.2. Annabelle knew this was the reason 
but ignored it and accepted the offer.
Annabelle’s brother John told her she was really letting the ratings 
get to her head but instead, she disagreed and started to insult her 
brother. Both had an argument which led to John giving his sister a 
minus rating. After this had happened Annabelle’s rating had gone 
down to 4.1.
