## Chapter 03

### Journey to the Wedding
Annabelle was on her way to the wedding and had got a taxi to the airport.
She was trying hard to get a rating from the driver, 
but she did not know she had annoyed throughout the journey 
which caused him to give her a minus rating. 
Once she was in the airport there a requirement that said 
you need to be 4.1 and over. Unfortunately, she had just recently 
turned into 4.0. She tried to beg the staff, but they refused to 
let her on. She started to get angry and started to curse and 
give out to the staff. 
Security had been called and automatically 
reduced her validation rating down by 0.5. Also, People behind her 
in the line were in shock and gave her a minus rating reducing her 
validation rating to 3.0 in total. Her only option was to leave and 
try to get a car rental so that she could get to the wedding on time. 
The journey is 15 hours long. She ended up getting a car to rent. 
After 8 hours on her journey, the carâ€™s battery had finished. 
She needed another way to get to the wedding, so she decided to 
start hitch-hiking. 
Luckily enough four hours towards the wedding 
with a journey of six hours a lovely lady driving a truck with not 
the greatest of appearances and a rating of below two was generous 
enough to give Anabelle a lift. She asked how she got here then 
Annabelle explained her whole story. The truck driver told Annabelle 
that she was pretty, and she should not base her life on validation. 
She told her she once used to behave like her then realized after a 
hard time that it was not worth it, and you should just be yourself. 
Annabelle was too stubborn to agree.
