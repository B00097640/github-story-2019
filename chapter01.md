## Chapter 01

### Looking through your history
It is 2090 where technology has taken over the world. The world has now evolved,
and money is longer used as a number one payment. A woman 
named Annabelle was a very well participated member of the application 
called validation. Validation would allow strangers, family, friends etc. 
to give you a rating. These ratings were crucial in many people’s eyes as it
would allow you to get high-class houses or cars and many other things. 
The highest rating anyone can achieve is 6. 

Many people would not be acknowledged because their rating was below 2. 
Annabelle was a very nice person with a rating of 4.5 which was very good in many people’s eyes. 
A man named George used to stand outside Annabelle’s workplace seeking for
validation knowing Annabelle she didn’t hesitate to give him a rating. 
She didn’t discriminate other people based on their ratings, 
but she took the validation application very seriously. 

There was one day Annabelle wanted to meet up with a housing agent. 
During the meeting, Annabelle was very fond of one dream house 
the housing agent it was possible for Annabelle to get after five years 
or if she wanted to speed things up she would need validation 
from people with rating minimum of 4.5. 
She took the advice from the housing agent and started to become someone 
she wasn’t. Annabelle ignored George because she didn’t want to slow her 
validation from rising for her to get her dream house.
