## Chapter 04

### Dream house

She had finally reached the wedding but was two hours late with 
security guarding the wedding. By the time Annabelle had got to the 
wedding she had just checked her phone and found out that Stacy had texted 
her 20 hours ago that the wedding was postponed. Annabelle got home 
and had apologised to her brother over the argument they had and told 
him he was right. She decided to take all the advice she was given and 
started to control her behaviour. 

A few weeks later Annabelle had become herself again and quickly rounded back up 
to the 4.2 rating she was originally at. It was the day of the wedding 
and Annabelle had a prepared speech for Stacy mentioning great things about 
her and said how much fun they used to have. Many people were amused by 
her speech gave her a rating. After the whole event she ended up with 
5.2 rating earning enough to get the dream house she wanted.
