## Chapter 04

### A real mess

She had finally reached the wedding but was two hours late with security 
guarding the wedding. She tried to enter but was not allowed because of 
her rating. She then came up with a solution to try and sneak in. 
She drops her bags and hopped the fence without letting security aware 
she had entered. Before she was about to land her dress got stuck she 
pulled it off the fence quite hard and succeeded but unfortunately landed 
on muck. 
It destroyed her face and he was all over her face and body. 
She was so eager to be at the wedding and had rushed in. 
She looked around and noticed she was not welcome because of her appearance 
and rating. This did not stop her from trying to make her speech. 
Stacy had seen what a mess she was and said that there’s no need for 
her to be her best woman anymore, but Annabelle refused and said she 
wanted to do this. 
Stacy was not happy and decided to call security. 
Annabelle started her speech and decided to talk about the times where 
Stacy use to bully her and explained how much she wanted to be like Stacy. 
All the guests weren’t happy with Annabelle which caused many to give her a 
minus rating ending up with 0. She was finally caught by the security and 
was later arrested.
